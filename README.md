# WoW-Character-Viewer-3D
Unity based app to view character models from wow and dress them up.

Models required for it to work can be downlaoded from:
character: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Av-LW1jhrWyooA2uqMUHiH9oBEhK?e=kbHhA9
creature: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Av-LW1jhrWyooAz2Q21Py12OAgMA?e=G485Bq

You simply unzip them into Resources folder then use custom WoW Character Viewer 3D menu to Generate bytes files. Then you can reimport the m2 files. After that bytes files can be deleted using Clean up option in that menu.
